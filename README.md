# Countdown Timer

![Workflow result](https://github.com/andremion/AndroidDevChallenge-Compose-CountdownTimer/workflows/Check/badge.svg)


## :scroll: Description
A Simple Countdown Timer for the propose of [Android Dev Challenge 2](https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2021/03/android-dev-challenge-2.html)


## :bulb: Motivation and Context
I've used that nice [UI proposal](https://www.uplabs.com/posts/daily-ui-14-countdown-timer) from [Uplabs](https://www.uplabs.com/). 

All the help I needed I've got from [Developer Android site](https://developer.android.com), specific from:
- [Lifecycle and side-effects](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/lifecycle)
- [Compose Animation Codelab](https://developer.android.com/codelabs/jetpack-compose-animation)
- [Animation](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/animation)

There's a lot of content there that made me possible to build that screen combining states and animations APIs
